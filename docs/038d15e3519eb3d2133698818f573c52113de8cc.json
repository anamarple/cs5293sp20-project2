Indeed, 17% of influenza cases are acquired in a healthcare setting [2] . Sick healthcare workers (HCWs) serve as a reservoir for influenza and may transmit the virus to vulnerable patients [3, 4] . To prevent transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that HCWs with fever and respiratory symptoms be excluded from work until at least 24 hours after they are afebrile without the use of antipyretics [5] . In contrast, the CDC suggests that HCWs with respiratory symptoms but no fever be allowed to work, provided that they wear a face mask during patient care activities and adhere to proper respiratory etiquette and standard precautions. Such afebrile HCWs are generally considered to be at low risk of transmitting influenza to patients. However, a recent event that occurred at our 600-bed hospital in Chicago raised concern for influenza transmission by an afebrile HCW.",

However, HCW compliance with face masks and other personal protective equipment is self-reported to be around 60% but often observed to be less than this [10] . It is unlikely that HCWs with respiratory viral illnesses would have a much higher compliance with this policy. Until better hand hygiene and personal protective equipment compliance is demonstrated across multiple healthcare settings, it would be inadvisable to rely solely on these measures to preclude the spread of influenza in hospitals.",

A mandatory influenza testing program for all HCWs with respiratory symptoms is one such measure, but is admittedly expensive and labor-intensive. The FilmArray Respiratory Panel alone can cost the laboratory up to $200 per panel, including labor and equipment. A more limited screening program may be sufficient, only testing employees with direct patient care or those with certain symptoms, such as cough. We found that 100% of employees with influenza disclosed having a cough. During the screening program at our hospital, 276 employees reported coughing; if we had only screened HCWs with cough, we could have reduced the number tested for influenza by 40%.",

Although not statistically significant, a higher percentage of HCWs who had not received the influenza vaccine were febrile than HCWs who had received the influenza vaccine (61% vs 45%). The influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce the incidence of influenza among healthy adults, and may reduce the severity of illness among vaccinated individuals who do develop influenza [11] [12] [13] [14] . If vaccination predisposes to subclinical or less severe influenza, it may actually contribute to HCWs working with influenza because they have mild illness. Although several studies have shown that vaccination of HCWs may decrease the risk of nosocomial influenza [15] [16] [17] [18] , our findings highlight the importance of not relying solely on influenza vaccination of HCWs for prevention of nosocomial influenza transmission.",

            "text": "Our study does have limitations. The temporary policy required influenza testing for afebrile HCWs with respiratory symptoms, but not for febrile HCWs as they were expected to stay home from work regardless of their test results. HCWs with fever and more severe symptoms may not have chosen to be tested, and so we may have underestimated the proportion of influenza-positive HCWs with fever and severe symptoms. Conversely, there were likely asymptomatic HCWs or those with mild symptoms who were not tested, in which case we would have overestimated the proportion of HCWs with influenza with fever. Other HCWs may have been diagnosed with influenza or other respiratory viruses by outside clinicians and not have reported their results to their employer. An additional limitation is that vaccination status was collected based on self-report. It is possible that sick HCWs' self-report of vaccination status was not entirely accurate, but there is no reason to believe that febrile HCWs with influenza would systematically report vaccination status differently than afebrile HCWs with influenza. Another potential limitation is that the determination of \"fever\" was also partially based on self-report. Some HCWs who reported fever may not have had an objectively measured temperature >37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F). However, hospitals' sick policies rely on HCWs' self-assessment of fever to determine whether or not they are eligible to work, and so self-report of fever more accurately reflects the true condition of fever identification among HCWs in the workplace. PCR may not be 100% sensitive for detection of influenza, and we may have missed some cases of influenza if individuals had a low viral load or if specimens were not properly collected. However, PCR is more sensitive than other influenza diagnostic tests including viral culture [19, 20] . Finally, these data were collected only during the 2013-2014 influenza season when the H1N1 strain was the predominant circulating strain; it is unknown if our findings are generalizable to other strains of influenza.",
