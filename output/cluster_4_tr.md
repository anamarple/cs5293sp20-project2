Summary : 
NIM811 was generously provided by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland).
Incubation at −80 °C for 1 h resulted in DNA precipitation.
Unspecific binding was blocked through incubation with 5% goat serum for 1 h at 37 °C.
Each sample was charged with 6 μL 5 M NaCl and incubated under shaking conditions for 2 h at 4 °C.

203. Document: PMC6893776
Summary : 
In most of the events described above the exact molecular mechanisms are not known.
Subcellular localization was monitored with confocal microscopy (Figure 1).
Overexpression of TBK-1 resulted in autophosphorylation of itself.
So far, most studies have focused on type I IFNs.

Summary : 
The conjunctiva is the mucus membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the globe.
Clinically, this manifests as reduced vision, foreign body sensation, and photophobia [33,34,35].
Further, due to their apparent immunological origin, SEIs are unresponsive to direct-acting antivirals.
The same findings were reproduced in vivo.
